            <p>In remote sensing data analysis and computer vision, aerial image segmentation is a crucial research
              topic,
              which has many applications in environmental and urban planning. Recently, deep learning is using to
              tackle
              many computer vision problem, including aerial image segmentation. Results have shown that deep learning
              gains
              much higher accuracy than other methods on many benchmark data sets. In this work, we propose a neural
              network
              called NASNet-FCN, which based on Fully Convolutional Network â€“ a frame work for solving semantic
              segmentation
              problem and image feature extractor derived from state-of-the-art object recognition network called Neural
              Search Network Architecture.</p>

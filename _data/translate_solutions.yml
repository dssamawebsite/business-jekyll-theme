    "In remote sensing data analysis and computer vision, aerial image segmentation
    is a crucial research topic, which has many applications in environmental and urban planning.
    Recently, deep learning is using to tackle many computer vision problem, including aerial image
    segmentation. Results have shown that deep learning gains much higher accuracy than other methods
    on many benchmark data sets. In this work, we propose a neural network called NASNet-FCN,
    which based on Fully Convolutional Network – a frame work for solving semantic segmentation
    problem and image feature extractor derived from state-of-the-art object recognition network
    called Neural Search Network Architecture."
